# Developer guide and rules for coding agents

AAD (2D drafting fork) is an open-source, pure-Rust 2D computer-aided drafting application for
architectural and civil work. It is a Windows-only program for now: macOS, Linux and the web are later phases. Start with [README.md](README.md), [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/status.md](docs/status.md) (what exists and what is only planned).

## Scope: 2D only
3D features, parametric constraints and mechanical-engineering commands are out of scope and have
been removed (see [docs/status.md](docs/status.md)). DXF import projects 3D polylines and 3D faces onto
XY, skips meshes, flattens every entity, and reports 3D solids it cannot flatten
([docs/maintenance.md](docs/maintenance.md)). Points keep a `z` field for DXF round-trip fidelity; do
not add 3D behaviour or mechanical features. Keep the general drafting, annotation, layer, block,
hatch, layout and plot commands.

## Never crash
A crash loses someone's drawing. **This outranks feature work.**
- **No panics in non-test code:** no `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`; no `unsafe` (`unsafe_code = "forbid"`).
- **Errors are `Result<T, E>`** through the crate's error type and `?`. An unfinished feature returns an error or reports "not available yet"; it never panics.
- **Input-derived numbers are hostile** (DXF/DWG files, command-line text, MCP, control and agent parameters): `get()` not `[i]`, checked arithmetic, no NaN casts, cap input-sized allocations and loop counts.
- **Bound recursion** (nested or cyclic block references: `MAX_BLOCK_DEPTH`).
- **Last-resort guard:** `Session::execute` and every step of an interactive command run under `catch_unwind` (`crates/engine/src/guard.rs`); an escaped panic restores the drawing and reports an error.
- **Prove it:** every crash fix lands with a regression test (see `hostile_params_never_panic`, `hostile_dxf_does_not_panic`).
- Every production crate root carries `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic, clippy::unimplemented, clippy::todo, clippy::unreachable)]`.

## Non-negotiables
- **Clean-room.** Never read, disassemble or copy anything from Autodesk software; never copy Autodesk fonts (SHX), hatch patterns (`.pat`), linetypes (`.lin`), templates, CUI/PGP files, icons, artwork or help text; never commit files produced by AutoCAD. File formats come from public specifications (Autodesk's published DXF Reference, the Open Design Alliance's public DWG specification) and our own synthetic tests. Never copy or link GPL/LGPL/AGPL code (LibreDWG, LibreCAD, QCAD, SolveSpace, OpenCASCADE).
- **Assets.** AAD contains no Autodesk, Adobe or Avid iconography, images, fonts, patterns or artwork. Every icon is drawn in code (`crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`), every hatch pattern and linetype is our own definition (`crates/doc/src/library.rs`), the drafting font is our own (`crates/fonts/src/stroke.rs`). Any file asset must be original, public domain/CC0, OSI-licensed or redistributable Creative Commons, and must have a row in `ATTRIBUTION.md` (`cargo xtask assets` enforces it).
- **Fonts** are never committed. They are an optional build input (`CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`); code and tests must work without them.
- **Everything is a command.** User-visible behaviour is a command in `crates/engine/src/cmd/*` (`CommandSpec`: id, label, menu path, shortcut, aliases, params doc, `enabled`, JSON `run`, optional `interactive` prompt machine) with tests. UI-only commands live in `crates/ui-egui/src/menus.rs` (`UI_COMMANDS`). The command line, menus, toolbar, tool sets, scripts, CLI, control channel, MCP and the agent tools reach the same commands. New features reuse existing commands where possible.
- **Programmatic calls never open dialogs.** `engine.execute` runs the JSON form with defaults; only menu or toolbar invocation starts the prompt sequence.
- **Layering** is enforced by `cargo xtask layers`: L0 `geom`, `dxf` → L1 `color`, `doc` → L2 `fonts`, `render` → L3 `io` → L4 `engine` → L5 `ui-egui`, `mcp`, `agent` → apps. Nothing below L5 depends on egui/eframe/winit/wgpu/rfd. The UI crate is swappable.
- **The UI is thin:** panels read engine state and act through `app.run(id, params)`, `app.start(id)` and `app.cmdline(text)`. Colours come from `theme::Tokens`; there are two palettes (dark with a black drawing area, light with a white one) and no other colour customisation.
- **The AI never calculates or repairs.** The model only proposes calls to allow-listed tools; geometry, repairs and quantities come from deterministic engine commands ([docs/ai-agent.md](docs/ai-agent.md)).
- **Rust only** (no handwritten JS/TS). Keep the code portable: the wasm check (`cargo xtask wasm`) stays in CI so the later phases (macOS, Linux, web) do not start from a broken base. Do not add features that only work elsewhere.
- **Do not claim a feature works unless it exists and has a test.** Documentation separates implemented from planned ([docs/status.md](docs/status.md)).
- **Quality gate** before every commit: `cargo xtask ci` (fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, assets, layering, wasm).

## Running and inspecting the app
- `cargo run --release -p aad -- --sample --control PORT` starts the app with a sample drawing and the control channel. Pick a free port.
- Drive it with JSON lines on `127.0.0.1:PORT`:
  - `{"id":1,"method":"cmdline.input","params":{"text":"circle 0,0 5"}}` types at the command line like a user.
  - `{"id":2,"method":"engine.execute","params":{"command":"line","params":{"points":[[0,0],[10,0]]}}}` is the JSON form.
  - `{"id":3,"method":"ui.screenshot","params":{"path":"shot.png"}}` writes a PNG.
  - Methods: `crates/ui-egui/src/control.rs`; protocol: [docs/control-protocol.md](docs/control-protocol.md).
- For UI work, look at the result (screenshot). If no frame is presented (screen locked) use `ui.render` or `aad-cli`.
- Headless: `aad-cli run --sample --script 'LINE 0,0 10,10\n' --export out.png`; `aad-cli info file.dxf`; `aad-cli mcp`.
- Parallel agents: use a separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per agent and edit only the crates you own.

## Documentation rules
- English only. Technical documentation only: architecture, APIs, configuration, installation, testing and maintenance. No marketing or promotional text.
- Update [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) when functionality lands, and describe only what exists.
- `docs/parity-checklist.md` is generated by `cargo xtask parity`; do not edit it by hand.
