# UI testing strategy

How the O-Draft interface is tested, which tools were chosen and why, how to run it, and what is not
covered yet. Windows is the supported platform for now.

## What the interface is (inspected, not assumed)

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Framework | The tests below cover the egui window (`cargo build -p aad --features egui` then `aad --egui`): native Rust, **egui / eframe 0.36** (`crates/ui-egui`); a thin layer over the engine (`app.run`, `app.start`, `app.cmdline`). The default Windows binary is WinUI-only; that shell is covered by `aad-host` tests |
| Rendering | The drawing is a GPU mesh painted through an `egui-wgpu` callback (`crates/ui-egui/src/gpu.rs`); widgets are egui's own. When there is no GPU target the canvas falls back to painting on the CPU |
| Input | egui events: pointer, keys, wheel, text. The canvas reads them in `canvas.rs`; shortcuts in `menus.rs::shortcuts` |
| Tools, panels, dialogs | Tools are engine commands with prompts; panels are docked (`docking.rs`); dialogs are `formdialog.rs` (generated from the command forms) and `dialogs.rs` |
| Stable identifiers | egui does not expose an OS accessibility tree here, but AccessKit labels are present: the control channel's `ui.elements` lists 66 elements at launch, every one with a label |
| Test mode | `CadApp` runs without a window under `egui_kittest`; the real app has a JSON control channel (`--control PORT`, `docs/control-protocol.md`) with `ui.inspect`, `ui.elements`, `ui.click`, `ui.key`, `ui.screenshot` |
| Platforms | Windows x64 now; macOS, Linux and web later |

## Tools chosen

| Need | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Interaction tests with real pointer and key events | **`egui_kittest`** (already a dev-dependency, 0.36) | It runs the actual `CadApp::logic` and `CadApp::ui` and injects egui events at screen positions, so tests click where a person clicks, inside the real layout. No second framework needed |
| Application state | the engine's `Session` (selection, running command, drawing) | Assertions check geometry and command state, not only that an event fired |
| Whole-menu checks | `menus::tree` + `CadApp::start` | Every menu entry is walked automatically |
| Visual checks | `Harness::render()` (wgpu) writing PNGs, in existing tests, to a folder named by `CRAFT_UI_VISUAL_DIR` | Already used by `chrome_geometry` and `docking_workflows` |
| Real-application measurement | the control channel against `aad.exe` | The only way to measure the GPU canvas; the harness cannot |
| Browser tools (Playwright etc.) | **not used** | The product is a native application; the web build is a later phase |
| OS-level UI automation | **not used** | `egui_kittest` plus the control channel cover the same ground with stable results |

No overlapping framework was added. One dev-dependency was added to `aad-ui-egui`
(`aad-io`, a workspace crate, to register file formats in the save-and-reopen test).

## The suites

| File | What it does | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/ui-egui/tests/drawing_workflow.rs` | Draw a line, circle, rectangle and polyline by clicking; Escape and Enter; click, window and crossing selection; move, copy, rotate, erase; undo and redo; zoom extents; resize the window at four sizes and pick an object at each; save and reopen a DXF | deterministic, runs in `cargo test` |
| `crates/ui-egui/tests/menu_integrity.rs` | Walks all 282 menu entries: each command id exists; activating each one has an observable effect, except nine that are listed with a reason | deterministic |
| `crates/ui-egui/tests/ui_latency.rs` | Times frames, pointer moves, tool activation, click select, property update and wheel zoom at 10 000 and 100 000 entities | **hardware dependent, `#[ignore]`**, prints numbers, asserts nothing about speed |
| existing: `chrome_geometry`, `docking_workflows`, `shared_controls`, `workspace_modes`, `workspace_focus`, `context_menu`, `dialog_dispatch`, `style_dialogs`, `text_double_click`, `system_cursor`, `widgets`, `control_cmdline*`, `open_bytes` | status-bar overlap at four window sizes and two scales, docking drag/float/close/reload, control sizing, Pro/Classic workspaces, focus, context menu, dialogs, text edit, widgets | deterministic |

## Run locally

```text
cargo test -p aad-ui-egui                                   # all UI tests (about 15 s after a build)
cargo test -p aad-ui-egui --test drawing_workflow           # the drawing workflow
cargo test -p aad-ui-egui --test menu_integrity -- --nocapture   # prints the menu summary
CRAFT_UI_VISUAL_DIR=target/ui-shots cargo test -p aad-ui-egui --test chrome_geometry   # save screenshots

cargo test --release -p aad-ui-egui --test ui_latency -- --ignored --nocapture         # frame timing
AAD_LATENCY_N=10000 cargo test --release -p aad-ui-egui --test ui_latency -- --ignored --nocapture
```

To measure the real GPU canvas, write a drawing and open it in the app:

```text
AAD_LATENCY_WRITE=%TEMP%\synth.dxf AAD_LATENCY_COUNT=100000 cargo test --release -p aad-ui-egui --test ui_latency write_synthetic -- --ignored
target\release\aad.exe --control 47123 %TEMP%\synth.dxf
```

then send `ui.inspect` (it returns `perf.frameMs`, `buildMs`, `meshMs`, `renderer`) and `ui.move` over
`127.0.0.1:47123` as described in `docs/control-protocol.md`.

## Writing a UI test

- Build the app like the existing tests (`CadApp::new`, `app.ui.in_window_menu = false`, a `Harness`
  sized explicitly, `run_steps(5)` to settle).
- Convert world to screen with `app.canvas.xf` and click there; **keep gestures away from the
  canvas edge**, where the docked panel's resize area takes the press. (Two of the first draft tests
  failed for exactly this reason and one for a wrong expectation; neither was an application bug.)
- A drag needs several intermediate `PointerMoved` events, as `drag` in the test does.
- Assert the drawing, selection and `session.running`, not only that an event was sent.
- Before trusting a new test, make it fail once (wrong expectation or removed fix).

## Interaction model (what the tests encode)

This product follows the classic click model; the tests state it so a change is noticed:

- a click on empty space opens a selection window (it does **not** deselect); Escape clears the
  selection and cancels the window;
- a drag opens a window: left to right selects what is fully inside, right to left also selects what
  it crosses;
- Escape cancels a command, Enter finishes a polyline, right-click acts as Enter while a command
  runs.

## Not covered yet

See [UI_TEST_MATRIX.md](UI_TEST_MATRIX.md) for the item-by-item status. In short: no approved
screenshot baselines, no automated check of dialogs staying inside small windows beyond the existing
ones, no per-control keyboard (Tab order) test, no real-GPU frame measurement in CI, the UI tests
are not yet a separate CI job. The harness paints on the CPU, so its frame times are not the GPU
app's.
